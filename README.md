# **💀 Memento Mori Repo**  
#### *A GitHub Action That Reminds You... You're Gonna Die*  

> *"You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say."* — Marcus Aurelius  

Welcome to **Memento Mori Repo**, a **GitHub Action that gently (or not so gently) reminds you of your mortality**. Every day, a new **stoic reminder** will appear in your GitHub Issues, urging you to **embrace impermanence, focus on what matters, and maybe even push that commit** before it’s too late.  

Once a year, on a solemn day, you will receive a **"Death Anniversary" reflection**, reminding you to stop wasting time and live wisely.  

### **🛠️ What This Does**  
✅ Posts a **daily GitHub Issue** with a **random Memento Mori quote** (stoic wisdom, philosophical truths, and occasional dark humor).  
✅ **Closes** the previous day's reminder to keep things clean.  
✅ Once a year, posts a **"Death Anniversary Reflection"**, because **Seneca says you’re probably wasting time**.  
✅ Runs automatically, so you can **focus on living well... or at least debugging**.
