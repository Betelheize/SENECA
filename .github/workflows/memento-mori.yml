            "Memento mori: Remember, you must die. This is not a curse, but the most profound truth that liberates you from triviality."
            "Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. Yet its certainty should inform every breath you take."

The calendar resets, but the clock doesn't stop.\n\nSeneca said we don't have a short time to live—we just waste most of it. He was right. Think about the past year. How much of it was spent on things that actually mattered? How much was frittered away on distractions, anxieties about things you can't control, or pursuits that looked important but weren't?\n\nThe Stoics were obsessed with this question because they understood something fundamental: you're going to die. Not someday in the abstract future, but actually die. And you don't know when. Could be fifty years. Could be tomorrow.\n\nThat's not meant to be depressing. It's meant to be clarifying.\n\nWhen you really internalize your mortality—not just acknowledge it intellectually, but feel it—everything changes. The petty grievances fall away. The ego-driven pursuits lose their luster. What remains is what actually matters: character, relationships, contribution, growth.\n\nMarcus Aurelius kept reminding himself: "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think." He was the most powerful man in the world, and he still needed that reminder. We all do.\n\nSo here are some questions worth sitting with:\n\nIf you died today, would you be satisfied with how you lived this past year? Not whether you achieved all your goals or made enough money or impressed enough people. But whether you lived with integrity. Whether you were kind when it was difficult. Whether you were brave when it mattered. Whether you grew.\n\nWhat fears held you back? What did you not do because you were worried about looking foolish, or failing, or being judged? How much time did you waste being afraid of things that never happened?\n\nDid you spend your energy on things within your control, or did you exhaust yourself trying to control things you can't—other people's opinions, the past, the future, the randomness of life?\n\nWere you the person you want to be? Not the person you tell yourself you are, but the person your actions reveal you to be?\n\nThe Stoics believed the only true good is virtue: wisdom, justice, courage, temperance. Everything else—money, status, pleasure, even health—is indifferent. Not bad, just not what makes a life good. Have you cultivated virtue? Have you become wiser, more just, more courageous, more disciplined than you were a year ago?\n\nEpictetus said philosophy without action is worthless. You can't think your way to a good life. You have to live it. Every single day is practice. Every interaction is a test. Every challenge is an opportunity to embody what you claim to believe.\n\nThe obstacle is the way. What stands in the way becomes the way. This isn't just a nice saying—it's a fundamental reorientation. The difficulties you face aren't preventing you from living well. They're the very means by which you develop the strength to live well.\n\nSo what changes this year?\n\nNot resolutions. Not grand plans that fall apart by February. But a genuine shift in how you approach each day. Begin at once to live, Seneca said. Count each day as a separate life. Don't wait for the perfect moment. Don't wait until you're ready. You'll never be ready. Start now.\n\nMemento mori. Remember you must die.\n\nNot as a curse. As a gift. As the one true thing that makes everything else matter.`;
